# MAE_TTT
Test-Time Training is an approach that aims at better generalization by using the hint on the data distribution given by test data. It allows the model to adapt its parameters during Test-Time in a self-supervised way, such that it keeps learning better feature representations even during testing. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze this Test Time Training (TTT) technique.

## Test Time Training with Masked AutoEncoder

Codebase studying Test Time Training with MAE for image classification based on [Gandelsman & al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07522.pdf), for a school project in the Object Recognition and Computer Vision Course (G. VAROL, A. JOULIN, I. LAPTEV, J. PONCE, C. SCHMID, J. SIVIC) at Master 2 MVA at Ecole Normale Superieure.

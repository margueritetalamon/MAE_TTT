# MAE_TTT
Test-Time Training is an approach that aims at better generalization by using the hint on the data distribution given by test data. It allows the model to adapt its parameters during Test-Time in a self-supervised way, such that it keeps learning better feature representations even during testing. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze this Test Time Training (TTT) technique.
